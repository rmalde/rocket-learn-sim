Allows the worker to run a human player, letting the AI play against and learn from human interation.

Important things to note:

-The human will always be blue due to RLGym camera constraints
-Attempting to run a human trainer and pretrained agents will cause the pretrained agents to be ignored. 
    They will never show up.
